# Shopping

Create a shop with two pages:
- Products `products.html`
- Cart `cart.html`

Our shop has a List of products.
- Every product should have an 'add to cart' button that should add the product to a list that's also stored in localStorage
- The cart should be displayed with the same content on the products page and also on the dedicated cart page

## Instructions
- Discuss with your team, what exactly needs to be defined and exported in the JavaScript files in order to be imported and used in `index.js`
- Coordinate with your team who should work on which functionalities and in which files
- Write the code to make the product list and cart work
- The product data is in `./data/productData.json`
- Use strict mode
